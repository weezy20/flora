You can either:

1. Work with a service defined in an existing, unmodified docker-compose.yml.
2. Create a new docker-compose.yml (or make a copy of an existing one) that you use to develop a service.
3. Extend your existing Docker Compose configuration to develop the service.
4. Use separate VS Code windows to work with multiple Docker Compose-defined services at once.
